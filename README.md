# Percolation

The executable Perc.py works in such a way that: A random matrix R of ones and zeros is created which
is treated with an algorithm almost identical to that of Hoshen-Kopelman for the identification of Clusters.
The executable returns an L matrix and a plot of it where you can see an array composed of well-identified clusters.
